## 1. Start with the Basics
We starts with basic stages like binding to a port and responding to PING commands. 
This aligns with the initial steps such as setting up a TCP server and handling simple commands.

Binding to a Port: We have to make sure our server can bind to a specific port and handle incoming client connections.
Responding to PING: We will implement basic command handling where the server responds with "PONG" when receiving the PING command.
