## 1. Start with the Basics
We starts with basic stages like binding to a port and responding to PING commands. 
This aligns with the initial steps such as setting up a TCP server and handling simple commands.

Binding to a Port: We have to make sure our server can bind to a specific port and handle incoming client connections.
Responding to PING: We will implement basic command handling where the server responds with "PONG" when receiving the PING command.



Stage 1: Bind to a port. 
Stage 2: Give Pong
Stage 3: A Redis server starts to listen for the next command as soon as it's done responding to the previous one. This allows Redis clients to send multiple commands using the same connection.

Stage 4: 
In this stage, you'll add support for multiple concurrent clients.

In addition to handling multiple commands from the same client, Redis servers are also designed to handle multiple clients at once.

To implement this, you'll need to either use threads, or, if you're feeling adventurous, an Event Loop (like the official Redis implementation does).
